# Define when the workflow runs (push and pull request events)
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger when code is pushed to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger when a pull request is opened targeting the 'main' branch

# Define the jobs in the workflow
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # The job will run on the latest version of Ubuntu

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Uses GitHub's checkout action to get the code

      # Step 2: Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'  # Use Python version 3.8 (can be changed)

      # Step 3: Install dependencies from the 'requirements.txt' file
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip  # Upgrade pip to the latest version
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'

      # Step 4: Run tests using pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest  # Runs tests using the pytest framework
